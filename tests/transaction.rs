        /// when using `ManuallyDrop`:
        ///
        ///  1. In order to obtain the necessary owned `RawTransaction` access in drop, such a field
        ///     would have needed to be wrapped in a `ManuallyDrop`, alongside writing a `Drop` impl
        ///     which would be doing:
        ///     `let raw_txn = unsafe { ManuallyDrop::take(&mut self.raw_txn ) }`
        ///
        ///  2. Then, in this `fn commit` function, because now we have this extra, txn-rolling-back
        ///     logic in the `Drop` `impl`, we shall need to `ManuallyDrop::new()`-wrap *all of
        ///     `self` in order to ensure we do not roll_back when that function returns, and the
        ///     locals the function owned, such as `self`, get dropped.
        ///
        ///  3. But in doing so, now there is a risk of having disabled too much drop glue, such as
        ///     resource-legitimate drop glue (symbolized, in this code sketch, by the owned `Weak`
        ///     handle).
        ///
        ///  4. Hence why the `fn` body, here, would have had to do:
        ///
        ///     ```rust
        ///     fn commit(self) {
        ///         // Subtle! Destructure `self` into all of its owned fields, by bypassing/having
        ///         // defused the (preprended) `Drop` glue *only* (the rest of the drop glue, that
        ///         // of the fields, remains active by virtue of getting back said fields).
        ///         let (raw_txn, _some_other_owned_resource, _each, _other, _field) = unsafe {
        ///             // Granted, this whole block is yearning to be macro-ed.
        ///             // Or even better: "Rust, y u no offer `let Self { raw_txn, .. } = self;`??"
        ///
        ///             let this = ManuallyDrop::new(self);
        ///             let Self {
        ///                 ref raw_txn,
        ///                 ref _some_other_owned_resource,

        ///                 ref field
        ///             } = *this;

        ///         // (yes, there are *two* distinct `ManuallyDrop`s at play, here‚Ä¶) we need to
        ///         // unwrap this layer, now. Luckily, our so-obtained owned access makes it
        ///         // trivial:
        ///         let raw_txn: RawTransaction<'_> = ManuallyDrop::into_inner(raw_txn);

        ///     }
        ///     ```
        ///
        /// Pretty scary, huh?
        ///
        /// FWIW, the "awkwardness" of the pattern needed here cannot really be avoided (except
        /// maybe by, perhaps counter-intuitively, wrapping as many fields within the initial
        /// `ManuallyDrop`).
        ///

        ///     //    We get back *owned access* to the innermost fields; mainly, our `raw_txn`, but
        ///     //    also, implicitly, the drop glue of the remaining fields as well: we have
        ///     //    effectively re-infused that transitive drop glue, which means our prior
        ///     //    defusing has *only* applied to the preprended `Drop` logic.

        ///         raw_txn,
